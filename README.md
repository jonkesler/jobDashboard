# Online / Offline Budget Tracker



## Description 
    
This Budget Tracker will allow you to lable and add or subtact transactions related to your budget.  It will keep a running total of your budget, show a graph of your budget and work on or off line.

This application uses a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and the backend implemented with Node.js, Express, a Mongo DB, and an indexedDb.

The user may enter any budget item and the app will track it.  Once the add of subtract button is clicked, the app adds the transaction to a Mongo database if online.  If offline the transaction will be stored locally in an indexedDb and once back online it will automatically update the Mongo database.
